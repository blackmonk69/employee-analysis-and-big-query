Analysis of employee demographics using GOOGLE BIG QUERY AND GOOGLE DATA STUDIO

This project is about using Google Big Query to load 5 csv files and creating 2 tables based on these files. The first table TABLE 1 is the result of joining ...
and TABLE 2 is the result of joining ...... . On the next step we link the 2 new tables with Data Studio to draw some insights and make a dashboard to answer some questions.

This project is a replica taken from internet (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPgurnF0II8), yet IT IS NOT A COPY since I replicated the steps in my own environment and even more I used Jupyter Notebook to help me in the process of Initial analysis. Table 1 was built using Pandas, you will find the notebook in this repo, there we created the column with the salary bins and education level in words.
Table 2 was made following the tutorial and created in Big Query.  

Then for the part of building the dashboard we chose the 2 tables as data source. Another difference with the original tutorial is that I am attaching a final page for Conclusions (under construction), because at the end of the day that is our job as data analyst.
